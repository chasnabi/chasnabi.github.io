   <h1>Thoughts and Observations</h1>
   <h2>Fillin' My Belly</h2>
      <p1 id="paragraph1"> On my way home from class today I stopped at Rusans for their lunch buffet. While I typically try to go for quality over quantity when it comes to sushi, after a fun morning of coding and lamentations over the wasted potential of Caprica, I found myself with a hankering. So I made my stop. </p1><br>

	    <p2 id="paragraph2">Somewhere in the middle of my third helping of calamari I got a phone call from my brother informing me that there was a package waiting for me at the post office. While I'm a frequent online shopper, I wasn't aware of anything that was supposed to arrive today. Surely it couldn't be my Captain Jack Harkness cosplay already! I just ordered that the other day and it's going to take at least a month to be made and ship here from China. So I got my check and headed out the door. The excitement built up at each red light and traffic jam I hit (and I'm sure you know that that can be a lot) and I found myself sprinting to the door when I finally arrived at the post office. When i got my package I found that I'd received a new set of wooden buugeng from the prop's inventor, the wonderful Dai Zaobab. I'd really like to be playing with them now but coding requires my full attention.</p2><br>
