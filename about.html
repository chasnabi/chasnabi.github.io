 <h1>The Tale of Chas</h1>
   <p id="thingy">The first chapter of my story begins in the snowy postindustrialized Hothlike wasteland that is Buffalo, New York. A town with as much charm as it has snow where the sports teams are more depressing than the cold, exhaust-colored snow on the landscape. This young grasshopper had enough of the cold and decided to fly south. I went to college and then out of college didn't really know what I wanted to do, so I took a job that would allow me to practice circus arts in my spare time</p><br>
      <p id="thingy2">Circus Arts are probably the best thing I've ever focused on. From the freedom of flying through the air-and the absolute trust to your partner and yourself that this entails-to eating fire without hesitation. It's a strange hobby, I know, but it's enriching and incredibly fulfilling.</p><br>

        <p>Now I'm in coding bootcamp at Tech Talent South. I try to make as many sci-fi and fantasy references as I can to see if I can get our instructor, Aaron, to laugh but perhaps I'm just not trying hard enough.</p>
